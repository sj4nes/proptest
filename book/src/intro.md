# Introduction

Proptest is a property testing framework (i.e., the QuickCheck family)
inspired by the [Hypothesis](http://hypothesis.works/) framework for
Python. It allows to test that certain properties of your code hold for
arbitrary inputs, and if a failure is found, automatically finds the
minimal test case to reproduce the problem. Unlike QuickCheck, generation
and shrinking is defined on a per-value basis instead of per-type, which
makes it more flexible and simplifies composition.

## Status of this crate

The majority of the functionality offered by proptest is in active use and
is known to work well.

The API is unlikely to see drastic breaking changes, but there may still be
minor breaking changes here and there, though this is becoming less common.

See the [changelog](https://github.com/AltSysrq/proptest/blob/master/proptest/CHANGELOG.md)
for a full list of substantial historical changes, breaking and otherwise.

## What is property testing?

_Property testing_ is a system of testing code by checking that certain
properties of its output or behaviour are fulfilled for all inputs. These
inputs are generated automatically, and, critically, when a failing input
is found, the input is automatically reduced to a _minimal_ test case.

Property testing is best used to compliment traditional unit testing (i.e.,
using specific inputs chosen by hand). Traditional tests can test specific
known edge cases, simple inputs, and inputs that were known in the past to
reveal bugs, whereas property tests will search for more complicated inputs
that cause problems.
